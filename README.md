# Amazon-Clone-Project
This is my new Project of Amazon Clone Website Built using HTML,CSS and Javascript
An Amazon clone website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simplified version of Amazon's e-commerce platform, focusing on creating core features of an online store. Hereâ€™s a brief description:

HTML (Structure): HTML provides the foundational structure for the website. It defines the layout, including the homepage, product listings, shopping cart, user profile, and checkout pages. It uses elements like div, header, section, footer, nav, and others to organize content.

CSS (Design): CSS is used for styling the website. It handles the design, such as the color scheme, fonts, layout (grid or flexbox), spacing, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or custom styles can be used for a more modern look.

JavaScript (Functionality): JavaScript adds interactive features. It enables functionalities like adding products to the cart, product filtering, searching, displaying product details, and handling the checkout process. JavaScript can also be used to dynamically update content without refreshing the page (using DOM manipulation and possibly AJAX).

Key Features of an Amazon Clone:

Homepage: Displays featured products, categories, search bar, and navigation.
Product Pages: Lists individual products with images, descriptions, and prices.
Shopping Cart: Users can add and remove items, adjust quantities, and view total price.
User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
Responsive Design: Ensures the website looks good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

This clone would be a basic version, omitting advanced features like payment integration or backend support, but it provides a solid foundation for a functional e-commerce site using just frontend technologies.
